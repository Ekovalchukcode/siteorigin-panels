<h1>Welcome To SiteOrigin Page Builder</h1>

<p>
	Page Builder by SiteOrigin makes it easy to create responsive column based content, using the widgets you know and love. Your content will accurately adapt to all mobile devices, ensuring your site is mobile-ready.
</p>

<p>
	Page Builder works with standard WordPress widgets, so youâ€™ll always find the widget you need. We've also created the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/so-widgets-bundle/" target="_blank">SiteOrigin Widgets Bundle</a> to give you a wide range of additional functionality. All the widgets are built on our powerful framework, giving you advanced forms, unlimited colours and 1500+ icons.
</p>

<h2>Simple Drag and Drop</h2>

<p>
	Reorder rows, move widgets, resize columns and build your page, all with your mouse. Page Builder makes it easy to nudge every detail into place, no matter how often you change your mind. We've meticulously crafted each and every interaction to make sure they all feel natural. It's intuitive content editing that doesn't sacrifice on functionality.
</p>

<h2>Live Editing</h2>

<p>
	The live editor gives you an exact preview of your content, that you can edit in real-time. You can use this to pin-point the sections and widgets you want to edit, then see those edits without leaving the page.
Create content in a fraction of the time.
</p>

<h2>History Browser</h2>

<p>
	Worry free editing is having the freedom to experiment without fearing mistakes. The History Browser lets you roll forward and back through your changes. Preview changes, then roll back to that version without skipping a beat.
Your personal safety net.
</p>

<h2>Row and Widget Styles</h2>

<p>
	Row and widget styles give you all the control you need to make your content uniquely your own. Change attributes like paddings, background colours and column spacing. You can also enter custom CSS and CSS classes if you need even finer grained control.
